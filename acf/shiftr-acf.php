/**
 * Shiftr ACF
 * 
 * The Advanced Custom Fields in Shiftr is controlled via PHP: https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/register-fields-via-php/
 * 
 * While this may seem like more effort, it actually makes working with the Flexi Blocks Builder incredibly easier.
 * Shiftr_ACF is a framework of sorts which makes working with ACF via PHP simpler and takes much of the effort
 * off the developers hands.
 * 
 * Another key reason for using PHP is that a Flexi Block, described below, will share settings across multiple 
 * types of Blocks, which is a massive pain to control over the GUI or JSON and can only be done manually. Working 
 * over PHP means settings only need to be setup once, and can be instantly shared across any Block.
 * 
 * Blocks:
 * A `Block` is a layout which belongs within the context of a Flexible Content field.
 * Blocks are registered in blocks/blocks.php by calling a new instance of the Flexi_Block class. Whereby
 * a new Flexi_Block instance is added to the `shiftr_blocks_library` global. A Block exists independantly of 
 * a Flexi_Builder (Flexible Content field) and can be added to multiple Builders.
 * 
 * Builders:
 * A Flexi Blocks Builder, or Builder for short, is a Flexible Content field which makes it very easy to add
 * Blocks to it. By default, all available Blocks are added to a Builder, however it is possible to assign
 * only a selection of Blocks. A Builder exists independantly of an ACF group, as it is only a field.
 * 
 * Groups:
 * A group is just that, it's an ACF group. It simply makes it easier to create a new group.
